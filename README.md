# Logistic-Regression

In this project, I will be discussing logistic regression and how it is implemented in R and Python. 

Logistic regression which is also known as the logit model, predicts the probability of an event occurring. It is used to model dichotomous outcome variables. Logistic regression implies that the possible outcomes are not numerical but rather categorical. Examples of such categories are: Yes / No or 1 / 0, i.e either the event happens (1), or it does not happen (0).

Logistic regression is a classification algorithm.
Logistic regression provides useful insights.
Logistic regression works well for cases where the dataset is linearly separable.
Logistic regression fails to predict a continuous outcome.
Logistic regression may not be accurate if the sample size is too small.
